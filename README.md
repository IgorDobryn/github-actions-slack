This Action allows you to send messages to Slack from your Github Actions. Supports Slack's required arguments as well as all the optional once. It's JavaScript-based and thus fast to run.

This action is just an HTTPS call to Slack API, so you can easily build this for yourself, or use this action or any one of the hundred other Slack actions available.

## Requirements

1. Slack Workspace and Channel
1. A Slack App and Bot - the App and Bot will be used to send messages to your channel. It sounds hard, but it's not :)
1. A Github Action - the place where you wants to send Slack messages
1. Github Secret - the Slack Bot auth token, used when posting messages to Github API

## Setup

**Required: Github Repository Secret:**

- `SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` - This is the bot token, the credentials for allowing you to send messages from github

**Required: Github Action Parameters:**

- `slack-channel` - The channel where you want the message

- `slack-text` - The text of the message

**Optional: Github Action Parameters:**

All the optional parameters that Slack supports, can be sent via the `slack-optional-xxx` parameter.

| Slack parameter name | Yaml parameter name         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `icon_emoji`         | `slack-optional-icon_emoji` |
| `link_names`         | `slack-optional-link_names` |

and so forth.

Please see Slack API documentation for all available optional parameters: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage

## Sample Action file with Slack Channel and Text

[.github/workflows/slack-notification.yml](.github/workflows/slack-notification.yml)

This will send a Slack message every time someone push, creates pull request or create an issue

```
name: slack-notification

on: [push, pull_request, issues]

jobs:
  slack-notifications:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sends a message to Slack when a push, a pull request or an issue is made
    steps:
      - name: Send message to Slack API
        uses: archive/github-actions-slack@master
        with:
          slack-bot-user-oauth-access-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          slack-channel: test-temp
          slack-text: Hello! Event "${{ github.event_name }}" in "${{ github.repository }}" ðŸ¤“
      - name: Result from "Send Message"
        run: echo "The result was ${{ steps.notify.outputs.slack-result }}"
```

## Sample Action file with Slack optional parameters

[.github/workflows/slack-notification.yml](.github/workflows/slack-notification.yml)

```
name: slack-notification-with-optional-parameters

on: [push, pull_request, issues]

jobs:
  slack-notification-with-optional-parameters:

        with:
          slack-bot-user-oauth-access-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          slack-channel: test-temp
          slack-text: Hello! Something is burning! Or not...
          slack-optional-icon_emoji: ":fire:"
          slack-optional-as_user: false

        run: echo "The result was ${{ steps.notify.outputs.slack-result }}"
```

## How to setup your first Github Action in your repository that will call this Action

### 1. Create a Slack bot

Follow this guide on how to create a Slack App and Bot for your workspace:

- https://slack.com/intl/en-se/help/articles/115005265703-create-a-bot-for-your-workspace

You should:

1. Create a new Slack App, https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1
1. Go to "Basic Information" > "Display Information" > "App icon & Preview" and add avatar for you App. This will be shown in Slack when you receive messages
1. Go to "Bot User" > "Add" and add a bot user to your Slack App
1. Go to "Install App" > "Install App to Workspace" to install your Slack App into your Slack workspace
1. Done

### 2. Save Bot Access Token on Github

To be able to send messages to slack, the Action needs the Auth Token for the Slack App. Since the Auth Token is sensitive information, you should NOT place it in the yaml file of the Action, but instead in the Github Secrets area.

1. Go to your App on Slack, https://api.slack.com/apps/
1. Go to "OAuth & Permissions" > "Bot User OAuth Access Token"
1. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`
1. Go to your Github Repo
1. Go to "Settings" > "Secrets" for the repo
1. Create a new secret called `SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value from `Bot User OAuth Access Token`
1. Done

### 2. Create a new Github Action

1. Go to your github repo
1. Go to actions
1. Create a new one, you can use the samples above

## Q&A

### It's not working

Please look at the individual steps on your github action. Maybe you have forgotten something.

### What information about the repo etc is available?

You can easily print everything you have while running the action. It can be a good way to see what you can send to Slack.

```
on: push

jobs:
  one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    steps:
      - name: Dump GitHub context
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
        run: echo "$GITHUB_CONTEXT"
      - name: Dump job context
        env:
          JOB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(job) }}
        run: echo "$JOB_CONTEXT"
      - name: Dump steps context
        env:
          STEPS_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(steps) }}
        run: echo "$STEPS_CONTEXT"
      - name: Dump runner context
        env:
          RUNNER_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(runner) }}
        run: echo "$RUNNER_CONTEXT"
      - name: Dump strategy context
        env:
          STRATEGY_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(strategy) }}
        run: echo "$STRATEGY_CONTEXT"
      - name: Dump matrix context
        env:
          MATRIX_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(matrix) }}
        run: echo "$MATRIX_CONTEXT"
```

### Why did you build your own?

It was a good way to learn more about Github Actions

### Why JavaScript and not Shell/etc?

_"JavaScript actions can run directly on any of the GitHub-hosted virtual machines, and separate the action code from the environment used to run the code. Using a JavaScript action simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action."_
(https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-actions)

### How does the Action JavaScript code work

It's simple, it just takes all the parameters and does an HTTPS POST to api.slack.com.

### I want another avatar to be used in Slack

By default the Avatar in Slack will be the same as for the Slack App you created. If you want to change this based on action, look at the https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage `icon_emoji` parameter.
